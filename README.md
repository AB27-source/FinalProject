# Web-based version of apple notes

## Inspiration:
I chose to make a simplified web-based version of the apple notes app so I can have my notes organized and at my disposal no matter what platform I am on.

## How to Use:
1. Go to (NotesApp)[https://angad-notes-app.herokuapp.com/]
2. Register for an account on bottom right of page if you do not have a login
3. Once registered, click on the ' + ' on the bottom right of the page to create a new note
4. On the new note page add the title of your note and its content. Then click save.
5. The search bar found on the top of the page can be used to search for a note using the title.
6. click logout on the on the top right of the page to sign out
